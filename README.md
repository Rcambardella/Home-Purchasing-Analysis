# Home-Purchasing-Analysis

An in-depth data analysis of U.S. housing affordability trends over the last 40 years, using real-world data to evaluate whether younger generations are truly at fault for declining homeownership.

> 📌 Is it really the younger generation’s fault that it’s harder than ever to purchase a home?

This project investigates how median income, home prices, interest rates, and inflation-adjusted purchasing power have changed from 1984 to 2024.

# Questions I was looking to find answers too
> Is the price of housing now at an all time high?

>Are the interest rates on loans the highest they have been?

> Have housing prices have increased faster than income?

> Do Millennials/Gen Z spend more on rent relative to income than older generations did at the same age?
